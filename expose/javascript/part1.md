# Lab 4 part 1 answers

1) values added: 20

2) final result: 20

3) values added: 20

4) It will return an error becasue when we use `let`, it will only be available withing that block (`{}`). Since the print statement in line 13 is outside of that block (the `if` statement), we will get an error.

5) It will result in an error. This is because `result` is declared as a `const` variable and in line 7, the code attempts to assign a new value to it which is not allowed.

6) Same thing, since `result` is a `const` variable, and we attempt to assign a new value to it on line 7, it violates the conditions and therfore throw an error.
